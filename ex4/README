AvlTree.java - include implementation for an avl tree, and two nested classes avl node and iterator

=============================

I've decided to use nested classes design, each Avl tree is a BST tree built from nodes , in the case of Avl
tree, its nodes are a little more complex then the nodes of BST tree, and this is the reason that I've decided
not to create two super classes BST tree and BST Node, because even though they Avl tree and the Avl node
both inherit from BST tree and tree node, I felt that it would make the API a lot more complicated, because
I would have Avl tree that inherits from BST tree, composed of Avl Nodes which inherit from BST Node, its
a lot simpler to have one class which contains two private nested classes AvlNode and an override for Iterator

=============================

the add method is based on the algorithm for adding a node to a BST tree, and after the new element was
added to the tree, a node height update takes place and afterwards a reorganization of the tree occurs
in case the balanced of the tree was broken, the same goes for the removal of a node from the tree
after a node has been removed the heights of the nodes is updated and if there is an imbalance the tree
get reorganized based of the type of the imbalance like RR,LL,RL,LR.
