I'v chosen to design the Spaceship class as an abstract class and all the other spaceships types extend the
basic Spaceship, I did it this way because it felt the most intuitive way,each spaceship is a type of the
basic spaceship, also in the future if someone would like to add another spaceship type to the game
all he would have to implement is the doAction method thus creating a code without repetition

=  Implementation details   =
=============================

In the Spaceship class I've added a lot of methods, and I've decided to make almost all of them protected
methods because the only classes that needs access to those methods are class that inherit from
the Spaceship class.

Special Spaceship - first of all I've decided that the Special Spaceship will create an harder game for
the user, I've done it by doubling the initial hp and energy for this type of spaceship, and I've took
the behavior of the aggressive basher and runner spaceship and fused them into one thus creating a spaceship
that will always accelerate towards the closet enemy ship it'll detect, fire whenever the angle to the target
is right, use the shield whenever the distance from the closet ship is low, and will try to teleport when it's
hp will drop bellow 5.

Drunkard Spaceship - this ship's driver has a chance of 1% in each round to lose it's keys to the spaceship
meaning that the ship won't do any action during 10 rounds and only drift in space, after those 10 rounds
the ship will enter a spin frenzy and fire throughout this phase, when this phase is completed the ship
the driver will have a chance of 1% again losing its keys and thus repeating the process, although if the
driver didn't lose its keys he will do a "serious move", meaning he will acquire a target and will have a
chance to accelerate towards the target, if the angle to the target is right the ship will hae a chance
to fire upon the target, and if the distance is close enough the ship will have a chance to turn on it's
shields, moreover each time the drunkard tries to make a "serious move" it'll have a chance of
spontaneously teleporting, all of those features create a pretty unpredictable opponent
